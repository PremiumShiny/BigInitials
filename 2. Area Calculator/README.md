USE:	Calculate the necessary flooring material to order.
DESC:	Program asks for length and width of room, printing room area. It will then account for 10% extra
        space and print out the final area. The program handles small dimensions where AREA > FINAL_AREA,
        and large dimensions where AREA > double size by printing an error. There is a check to see whether
        the user wants to continue using the program by utilising a loop. Handles catching of inputs
        containing only ".", and strings including non-digit characters by printing an error.
