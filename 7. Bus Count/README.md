# Bus Count
```
FILE:	BusCount.java
AUTHOR: Richard Cheung
DATE:	9 December 2019
USE:	Inputs bus route and how delayed the bus was. Terminating will display the latest route and how long it took
DESC:	Program asks for bus and late inputs cased in a while loop. Whilst the loop is still active, it checks
        whether the last route entered had a longer delay or not. If it did, the input route and delay will then
        be stored in its own variable as the longest delayed bus. When the program terminates, the program prints
        the longest delayed bus and how long it was delayed by.
